## Step 1: Install R

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

1. Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Click **"Download R for Windows"** → **"base"**
3. Click **"Download R-4.x.x for Windows"**
4. Run the `.exe` file with default settings

### Mac

1. Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Click **"Download R for macOS"**
3. Download the correct version:
   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** `arm64` version
   - **Intel Mac:** `x86_64` version

::: {.callout-tip}
## Not sure which Mac you have?
Click  → "About This Mac" → check "Chip"
:::

4. Open the `.pkg` file and install

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Verify installation
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
R --version
```

You should see `R version 4.x.x`.
:::

## Step 2: Install Positron (or Alternative IDE)

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a single app that combines the tools you need to do data analysis - typically a code editor, an R console, a file browser, and Git/version control - so you can work in one place.

Positron is a modern IDE built by Posit (the organization behind RStudio). We recommend it for this workshop because of its excellent R and Quarto integration.

### Positron vs RStudio (which should you use?)

- **Positron**: Newer, VS Code-based IDE from Posit. Great Quarto support, strong Git integration, and works well if you also use other languages (e.g., Python). Recommended for this workshop (the instructions/screenshots will match Positron). It also has a built-in terminal and works well with AI agents.
- **RStudio**: The classic IDE for R. Very stable and widely used. If you already use RStudio comfortably, feel free to stick with it - just make sure **Quarto** and **Git** are installed and working.

::: {.callout-note}
## Already using another IDE?
You can use **VS Code** or other VS Code-based IDEs such as **Cursor** and **Antigravity** instead. All modern IDEs support Git integration, R, and Quarto. If you're comfortable with your current IDE, feel free to use it — just make sure Git and Quarto extensions are installed.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

1. Go to <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases>
2. Download the latest `...-win-x64.exe`
3. Run the installer

### Mac

1. Go to <https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases>
2. Download:
   - **Apple Silicon:** `...-darwin-arm64.dmg`
   - **Intel:** `...-darwin-x64.dmg`
3. Drag Positron to Applications

::: {.callout-warning}
## "Cannot be opened" warning?
Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Click "Open Anyway"
:::

:::

**First launch:**

- Positron may ask to install additional components — click **Yes**
- It should detect R automatically
- You should see an R console at the bottom

## Step 3: Install Quarto

**Quarto** is a tool for writing documents that combine text and code. Instead of running your analysis in R, then copying results into Word, you write everything in one file — and Quarto generates tables, figures, and formatted text automatically.

In this workshop, you'll use Quarto to create reproducible reports and manuscripts where results update automatically when your data or code changes.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

1. Go to <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
2. Download the Windows installer (`.msi`)
3. Run with default settings
4. **Restart Positron**

### Mac

1. Go to <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
2. Download the macOS installer (`.pkg`)
3. Run with default settings
4. **Restart Positron**

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Verify installation
In terminal:

```bash
quarto --version
```

You should see `1.4.xxx` or higher.
:::

## Step 4: Install and Configure Git

**Git** is a version control system — it tracks every change you make to your files and lets you go back to any previous version. Think of it as "unlimited undo" with a detailed history of what changed, when, and why. All this history is stored **locally on your computer**.

In this workshop, you'll use Git to save checkpoints of your work. If something breaks, you can always recover a working version.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

1. Go to <https://git-scm.com/download/win>
2. Run the downloaded installer
3. **Important:** Select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
4. Accept other defaults
5. **Restart Positron**

### Mac

The easiest way — open Terminal and run:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git isn't installed, a popup will ask to install Command Line Tools. Click **Install**.

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Verify installation
In terminal:

```bash
git --version
```
:::

### Configure Git (Required!)

Set your name and email for commit history. In terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

::: {.callout-important}
Use your real name and email — they will appear in your project history.
:::

## Step 5: Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a cloud platform for storing your Git repositories. While it's often associated with team collaboration, **it's equally valuable when working solo**:

- **Backup & sync across devices** — Your full project history is safely stored in the cloud. Switch between your laptop and desktop seamlessly, or recover your work if your computer crashes.
- **AI-assisted workflows** — Tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Code can read your repository history, helping you understand past changes, generate commit messages, or continue where you left off.
- **Future collaboration** — When you eventually share your work with co-authors or reviewers, everything is already set up and reproducible.

Even if you never share your code, GitHub acts as a time machine for your projects.

1. Go to <https://github.com>
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Enter your email, create a password, and choose a username
4. Complete the verification process

::: {.callout-tip}
## Username tips
Choose a professional username — it will be visible to collaborators. Many researchers use variations of their name (e.g., `jsmith`, `jane-smith-epi`).
:::

### GitHub Education (Recommended for Students)

As a student (or anyone with a .edu email address), you can get **GitHub Pro for free** through GitHub Education. This includes unlimited private repositories, GitHub Copilot access, and more.

1. Go to <https://education.github.com/benefits>
2. Click **"Get student benefits"**
3. Verify your student status using your `.edu` email or student ID
4. Benefits are usually approved within a few days

::: {.callout-note}
GitHub Copilot (AI coding assistant) is included free with GitHub Education. It integrates directly with VS Code, Positron, and other IDEs.
:::

### Connect Git to GitHub

After creating your account, you'll need to authenticate Git with GitHub. We'll use the GitHub CLI for this.

1. Install GitHub CLI:
   - **Windows:** Download from <https://cli.github.com/>
   - **Mac:** `brew install gh` (or download from website)
2. Run in terminal:

```bash
gh auth login
```

3. Follow the prompts (select GitHub.com, HTTPS, and authenticate via browser)

## Step 6: Install R Packages

Open Positron and run in the R console:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",
  "gtsummary",
  "gt",
  "broom",
  "here",
  "NHANES",
  "rmarkdown",
  "knitr"
))
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| tidyverse | Data manipulation and visualization |
| gtsummary | Publication-ready summary tables |
| gt | Table formatting |
| broom | Tidy model output |
| here | File path management |
| NHANES | Workshop dataset (NHANES 2009-2012) |
| rmarkdown, knitr | Document rendering |

This takes 5-10 minutes. Warnings during installation are normal.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Verify installation

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(gt)
library(broom)
library(NHANES)
```
See if these packages load without errors.
:::

## Step 7: Create Your Workshop Repository

This is the final verification that everything works together. You'll create your own repository from a template and test your setup.

### 1. Create repository from template

1. Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/shibakoichiro/reproducible-research-workshop-shiba-template)
2. Click the green **"Use this template"** button → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Settings:
   - **Owner:** Your GitHub account
   - **Repository name:** `reproducible-workflow-workshop` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Visibility:** Public or Private (either works)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why "Use this template" instead of Fork?
Template creates a fresh repository with no connection to the original — perfect for starting your own project. Fork is for contributing back to someone else's project.
:::

### 2. Clone the repository

1. On your new repository page, click the green **"Code"** button
2. Copy the HTTPS URL
3. In Positron: **Source Control** panel → **Clone Repository**
4. Paste the URL and choose a location on your computer (e.g., `Documents/`)
5. Click **Clone** → **Open** when prompted

### 3. Complete the setup check

1. Open `setup-check.qmd` in Positron
2. Replace `"YOUR NAME"` with your actual name
3. Click **Preview** (top-left of editor) to render the document
4. Verify the HTML output is created without errors

### 4. Commit and push

1. Go to **Source Control** panel (left sidebar, branch icon)
2. You should see changed files listed
3. Hover over each file and click **+** to stage, or click **+** next to "Changes" to stage all
4. Enter commit message: `Complete setup check`
5. Click **Commit**
6. Click **Sync Changes** (or **Push**)

::: {.callout-note}
## First push?
Git may ask you to authenticate with GitHub. Follow the prompts — this is a one-time setup.
:::

### 5. Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub (refresh the page)
2. Confirm that `setup-check.qmd` shows your name
3. Confirm that `setup-check.html` was also pushed

::: {.callout-tip}
## All steps worked?
You're ready for the workshop! You've just completed your first Git workflow: **edit → commit → push**.
:::

## Optional: AI Assistants

AI tools can support many parts of your research workflow — **not required** for this workshop, but increasingly useful.

### How AI Can Help Your Research Workflow

| Task | How AI helps |
|------|--------------|
| **Writing & editing** | Draft methods sections, improve clarity, check grammar |
| **Code** | Write R code, debug errors, explain unfamiliar functions |
| **Quarto** | Generate YAML options, fix formatting issues, create templates |
| **Git** | Write commit messages, explain merge conflicts, suggest workflows |
| **Learning** | Explain concepts, walk through examples, answer "how do I...?" questions |

### Two Ways to Use AI

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Chat** | Open a website, ask questions, copy-paste text or code | ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini |
| **Agent** | AI runs inside your editor, reads your files, and makes edits directly | GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex|

::: {.callout-note}
## Which should you use?
**Chat** is the easiest way to start — just open a browser and ask questions. **Agents** are more powerful because they can see your entire project and make changes directly, but require setup.
:::

### Chat-Based AI

Use AI through a web browser. You copy-paste text, code, or error messages, and the AI responds with suggestions.

- **ChatGPT** (<https://chat.openai.com>) 
- **Claude** (<https://claude.ai>) 
- **Gemini** (<https://gemini.google.com>) 
    - A 1-year free premium plan for students ([Google AI Pro](https://gemini.google/students/))

Good for: Quick questions, editing prose, debugging error messages, learning new concepts.

### Agent-Based AI

AI that works directly with your files. It can read your documents and code, understand context, and make edits — no copy-pasting needed.

- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — Free for students (GitHub Education)
- **Codex** — OpenAI's agent
- **Gemini CLI** — Free for students (Google AI Pro; 1 year)
- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's agent
- **Cursor** — Free for students (1 year)

These tools run inside your IDE as extensions, in the terminal, or as built-in features.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Free options for students
**GitHub Copilot CLI** (via GitHub Education), **Cursor** (1 year free), and **Gemini CLI** (via Google AI Pro) are all free with student verification.
:::

### Bottom Line

Start with chat if you're new to AI tools. Move to agents when you want AI to work more directly with your project files.
