## What We Built Today

Over the past 3 hours, you created a complete reproducible workflow:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A["Raw Data"] --> B["data-cleaning.qmd"]
    B --> C["data_clean.rds"]
    C --> D["analysis.qmd"]
    D --> E["Tables & Figures"]
    D --> F["model_fit.rds"]
    E --> G["index.qmd"]
    F --> G
    C --> G
    G --> H["Word / PDF / HTML"]

    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style H fill:#c8e6c9
```

Every step is documented, every change is tracked, and the entire pipeline can be re-run at any time.

## Before vs After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Manual copy-paste of numbers | Code-generated tables and figures |
| "Which version is this?" | Git history shows every change |
| Fear of making changes | Confidence to experiment |
| Hours to redo analysis | Minutes to re-run pipeline |
| "I can't remember what I did" | Everything documented in code |

## Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-important}
## Three principles to remember

1. **Automate with code** → Reproducibility comes naturally when you eliminate manual steps
    - Function and iteration via purrr
    - Script-based publication-ready tables and figures

2. **Version control everything** → Never lose work, experiment freely, recover from mistakes

3. **Plain text is powerful** → Git-friendly, AI-friendly, future-proof
