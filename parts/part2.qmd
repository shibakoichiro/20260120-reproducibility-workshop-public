## Our Project Today

Throughout this workshop, we'll work with a real dataset:

- **Data**: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)
- **Goal**: Build a reproducible analysis report and manuscript

::: {.callout-tip}
## You're already set up!
In the [Setup Guide](../setup.qmd), you created your repository from a template, cloned it locally, and made your first commit. Now let's understand what you did and why it matters.
:::

## What is Git?

Git is **version control** for your entire project — think of it as "Track Changes" but for all your files, not just Word documents.

### The Basic Workflow

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Edit files] --> B[Stage changes]
    B --> C[Commit]
    C --> A
```

| Step | What it does | Analogy |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Edit** | Make changes to your files | Write your draft |
| **Stage** | Select which changes to include | Decide what goes in this "snapshot" |
| **Commit** | Save a snapshot with a message | Take the photo with a caption |

## Why This Matters

Version control solves real problems:

- **Every change is recorded** — See exactly what changed, when, and why
- **You can always go back** — Made a mistake? Just restore from a previous version
- **No more naming chaos** — Say goodbye to `final_v2_FINAL_really_final.docx`
- **AI-powered learning** — Use AI to identify patterns and review your thought process from commit history

## Git Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
Your project folder, tracked by Git. Contains all your files and their complete history.

::: {.callout-important}
## One Project = One Repository
Each paper or analysis project should have its own self-contained repository with code, documents, and data references together. Avoid structures where multiple projects share files from external folders — this breaks reproducibility when paths change or files move.
:::

### Commit
A snapshot of your project at a point in time. Each commit has:
- A unique ID (hash)
- A message describing the changes
- A timestamp
- The author

The **Diff View** lets you visualize exactly what changed between any two commits — which lines were added, modified, or deleted. This is invaluable for understanding your project's evolution.

### Staging Area
A holding area for changes you want to include in your next commit. This lets you commit related changes together.

### .gitignore
A special file that tells Git which files to **ignore** — they won't be tracked or shared. Use this for:

- **Sensitive data** — API keys, passwords, patient identifiers
- **Large data files** — Raw datasets that shouldn't be in version control
- **Temporary files** — Cache, logs, or intermediate files you don't need to keep

Example `.gitignore`:

```{.bash filename=".gitignore"}
# Sensitive files
.env
credentials.json

# Large data
data/raw/*.csv

# Temporary files
.Rhistory
*.log
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Sensitive Data
Never commit files containing passwords, API keys, or identifiable patient data. Once pushed to GitHub, they remain in the history even if deleted later.
:::

## Using Git in Positron

You don't need to memorize commands! Positron has a visual interface:

::: {.step-card}
#### The Source Control Panel

1. Look for the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (it looks like branches)
2. You'll see:
   - **Changes** — files you've modified
   - **Staged Changes** — files ready to commit

#### Making a Commit

1. Make changes to a file and save
2. In Source Control, click **+** next to the file to stage it
3. Type a commit message describing your changes
4. Click **Commit**
:::

## Good Commit Messages

A good commit message explains **why**, not just **what**:

| Good | Not as good |
|------|-------------|
| `Add age filter to include only adults` | `Update code` |
| `Fix typo in regression formula` | `Fix` |
| `Add demographics table with gtsummary` | `Changes` |

::: {.callout-tip}
## Keep it short but meaningful
Aim for messages that would help "future you" understand what you did and why.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## AI Can Help Write Commit Messages
AI tools can analyze your staged changes and suggest descriptive commit messages. This makes maintaining good commit history easier — especially when you've made many small changes and need help summarizing them.
:::

## Git vs GitHub

These are related but different:

| Git | GitHub |
|-----|--------|
| Local tool on your computer | Website for sharing repositories |
| Tracks changes in your project | Hosts your repository online |
| Works offline | Requires internet |
| Free and open source | Free for public repos, paid for some features |

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph local1["💻 Your Computer"]
        git1["Git Repository"]
    end
    subgraph cloud["☁️ GitHub"]
        remote["Remote Repository"]
    end
    subgraph local2["💻 Lab Computer"]
        git2["Git Repository"]
    end
    subgraph collab["👥 Collaborator"]
        git3["Git Repository"]
    end

    git1 <-->|push/pull| remote
    remote <-->|push/pull| git2
    remote <-->|push/pull| git3
```

In this workshop:
- **Git** manages version control locally
- **GitHub** stores your work online (backup + collaboration)

## Quick Reference

### Common Operations in Positron GUI

| To do this... | Do this... |
|---------------|------------|
| Stage a file | Click **+** next to the file |
| Stage all files | Click **+** at the top of Changes |
| Unstage a file | Click **−** next to the staged file |
| Commit | Type message, click **Commit** |
| Push to GitHub | Click **Push** (or sync icon) |
| Pull from GitHub | Click **Pull** |

### Common Terminal Commands (for reference)

```bash
git status           # See what's changed
git add filename     # Stage a file
git add .            # Stage all changes
git commit -m "msg"  # Commit with message
git log --oneline    # See commit history
git push             # Send commits to GitHub
git pull             # Get commits from GitHub
```

::: {.callout-note}
## You don't need the terminal (for now)
The Positron GUI handles all common operations. When we use terminal commands in [Part 5](part5.qmd#the-advisor-experience), you'll learn about working directories and how Positron makes this easy.
