## What is Reproducibility?

At its core, reproducibility means:

> **Same data** + **same code** = **same results**

But it's not just about allowing others to verify your work. It's about being able to reproduce your *own* analysis — whether that's next week, next month, or when Reviewer 2 asks for changes six months from now.

## Ask yourself
Can you reproduce your own analysis from 6 months ago? Do you remember which version of the data you used? Which script ran in which order?
:::

## Common Problems

These scenarios might sound familiar:

| Scenario | Root Cause |
|----------|------------|
| "Table 1 doesn't match the text" — your advisor | Manual copy-paste |
| `final_v3_FINAL.docx` — which is the real final? | No version control |
| Can't reproduce your 3-month-old results | Code and data separated, no documentation |
| "Just change X" leads to hours of work | Manual workflow, no automation |

::: {.callout-note}
## The common thread
All these problems share a root cause: **manual work**. Every time you copy a number, rename a file manually, or try to remember what you did, you are prone to make errors. This is inevitable, as we all make mistakes as humans.

## Today's Core Message

> **Three principles for reproducible research:**
>
> 1. **Automate** — Generate outputs from code, not copy-paste
> 2. **Integrate** — Keep code and text together in one place
> 3. **Track** — Version control everything with Git

This workshop will show you **how** to do this in practice.

| Principle | Tools |
|-----------|-------|
| **Automate** | gtsummary, ggplot2, R functions |
| **Integrate** | Quarto (.qmd files) |
| **Track** | Git + GitHub |

## Why Plain Text?

All the tools we'll use today work with **plain text** files (`.qmd`, `.R`, `.yml`). This matters because:

- **Git-Friendly** — Plain text shows exactly what changed between versions. Binary formats just show "file changed."
- **AI-Friendly** — AI tools can read, understand, and help you write plain text code
- **Future-Proof** — Plain text will always be readable. Can you open a 1995 Word document?
