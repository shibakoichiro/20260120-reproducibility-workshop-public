subtitle: "Work with Git users and Word users"

## Learning Goals

By the end of this section, you will:

- Share your work on GitHub
- Collaborate with others who use Git
- Work with co-authors who prefer Word
- Use Track Changes effectively

## Two Collaboration Scenarios

- **Git Users** — Use GitHub: clone, push, pull. Everyone sees the full history.
- **Word Users** — Render to `.docx`, receive Track Changes, apply edits back to qmd.

# Part 7a: GitHub Collaboration

## Why GitHub?

- Store your repository online (backup!)
- Share with collaborators
- Everyone sees the history
- No more emailing files back and forth

    end

    subgraph Cloud["GitHub"]
        B["Remote Repository"]
    end

    A -->|"push"| B
    B -->|"pull"| A
    B -->|"clone"| C["Collaborator's Computer"]
    C -->|"push"| B
```

**Git** = version control tool (local) | **GitHub** = website to share Git repositories (online)

::: {.callout-tip}
## You're already on GitHub!
In the [Setup Guide](../setup.qmd), you created your repository from the template and pushed your work to GitHub. Now let's collaborate!

## Self-Study: GitHub Collaboration {#github-collab-self-study}

::: {.callout-note}
## Self-Study Section
This exercise is best done with a **colleague or classmate** after the workshop. It takes about 10-15 minutes and teaches real-world Git collaboration.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Pair Exercise: Collaborate via GitHub (Click to expand)

::: {.step-card}
#### Find a partner and collaborate

**Setup:**

1. Share your GitHub repository URL with a partner
2. Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Collaborators**
3. Click **Add people** and enter your partner's username
4. Your partner accepts the invitation

**Clone and edit:**

1. Clone your partner's repository (green **Code** button → copy URL)
2. In Positron: **File** → **Clone Repository** → paste URL
3. Open their `index.qmd` and make a small edit
4. Save, stage, and commit with a message describing your edit
5. Click **Push**

**See the result:**

1. Check GitHub — you can see your partner's commit
2. In your own repo, click **Pull** to get their changes

## Beyond Today: Branches & Pull Requests

In larger teams:

1. Create a **branch** for your changes
2. Open a **Pull Request** (PR) for review
3. Team reviews and discusses
4. **Merge** after approval

Today we used a simplified workflow (direct push to main). In practice, branches prevent conflicts and allow code review.

# Part 7b: Working with Word Users

## The Reality

- Not all collaborators use Git
- Co-authors often prefer Word
- Track Changes is the standard for feedback
    - Unfortunately, there is no single principled way to work seamlessly between Word documents with tracked changes and qmd files (yet)

## The Bare Minimum Workflow

::: {.callout-important}
## Single Source of Truth
**qmd is always the "source"**

Word documents are output, not source. Changes should flow back to qmd.
:::

## The Word Collaboration Workflow

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A["index.qmd"] -->|"render"| B[".docx"]
    B -->|"send"| C["Co-author"]
    C -->|"Track Changes"| D["feedback.docx"]
    D -->|"review"| E["You"]
    E -->|"edit"| A
    A -->|"re-render"| F["Updated .docx"]
```

**Never edit the Word file as source!** Your edits will be lost on next render.

## Best Practice: One Sentence Per Line

In your qmd file:

```markdown
This is the first sentence.
This is the second sentence.
Each sentence on its own line.
```

**Benefits:**

- Easier to match Word changes back to qmd
- Better Git diffs (see exactly which sentence changed)

## Hands-on: Word Collaboration Cycle

::: {.step-card}
#### Step 1: Render to Word

1. Open `index.qmd`
2. Render to `.docx` format
3. Find the Word file in your project folder
:::

::: {.step-card}
#### Step 2: Simulate co-author feedback

Open the Word file and add some Track Changes:

- Suggest a wording change in the introduction
- Add a comment asking a question

Save the file with a new name: `manuscript_coauthor_feedback.docx`
:::

::: {.step-card}
#### Step 3: Review and incorporate changes

1. Open the Word file with Track Changes
2. For each change:
   - Manually apply the changes to the qmd file.
      - You can use `pandoc` to convert the Word file back to markdown and apply the changes to the qmd file, but it could change formatting.
      - You can also use AI to reflect the suggested changes in the Word file to the qmd file, but always verify nothing is missed.
      - **Manually applying the changes is recommended for learning purposes.**
3. For each comment:
    - Use GitHub issues
    - Or use the GitHub pull request comments and review functionality
        - This requires you create a separate git branch for the changes.
4. Re-render and verify
:::

::: {.step-card}
#### Step 4: Commit your progress

Don't forget to save your work with Git!

1. Go to **Source Control** panel
2. Stage `index.qmd`
3. Write a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Incorporate co-author feedback from Word review")
4. Click **Commit**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Good commit messages for collaboration
- "Add co-author edits from Track Changes review"
- "Incorporate advisor feedback on introduction"
- "Apply reviewer comments on methods section"
:::
:::

## AI for Track Changes

Speed up your review:

- AI can summarize many changes quickly
- "What are the main suggestions in this document?"
- Helpful for long documents with many comments

**Caution:** Always verify nothing is missed.

## Summary

| Collaborator type | Workflow |
|-------------------|----------|
| Uses Git | Branch, edit, push, pull |
| Uses Word only | Render → Track Changes → apply to qmd |

Both workflows keep **qmd as the single source of truth**.
