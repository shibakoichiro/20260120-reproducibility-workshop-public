## Overview

This hands-on workshop teaches you how to create reproducible research workflows using modern tools. You'll learn to write code and text together, generate publication-ready tables and figures, and track changes with version control.

### What you'll learn

- **Quarto documents** -- Write code and text together, render to HTML, PDF, or Word
- **Version control** -- Track every change with Git, recover from mistakes
- **Reproducible coding** -- Write reusable functions with `purrr` and create tables with `gtsummary` and figures with `ggplot2` that auto-update
- **Manuscript workflow** -- Separate analysis from writing using Quarto Manuscripts
